![A .proto is all you need – Organic Programming](op-proto.jpg)

A bio-inspired, Unix-inspired paradigm for a hybrid human–agent world
where legacy code coexists with new code, machines compose with machines,
and humans orchestrate the whole.

**All you need is a `.proto`** — a single contract that makes everything
naturally interoperable. Legacy code, new code, humans, agents: all speak
the same interface.
